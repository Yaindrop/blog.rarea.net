                Hello！Welcome to the rarea.
                </br>I'll briefly introduce myself and this website.
                </br>&emsp; • I was born in 2000, in Nanchang Jiangxi, China.
                </br>&emsp; • Nanchang No.10 Middle School, Class of 2017
                </br>&emsp; • UC Davis, Class of 2021, Major in Computer Engineering
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Interests</h3>
                &emsp; • Love Computer Science. I'm currently exploring all kinds of fields of CS.
                </br>&emsp; • Like playing games. Love sandbox games. But I'm not quite satisfied with any current sandbox game on the market. I'm looking forward to see or make a game that meets my expectation.
                </br>&emsp;   I believe the ultimate sandbox game should have the level of details that is similar to the real world, and let players literally be gods of the worlds by giving them the power to create rules and concepts.
                </br>&emsp;	• Love instrumental music, especially the touhou doujin instrumental music. Being infulenced by the Touhou Project for two years, now I cannot live without it.
                </br>&emsp;   I'm willing to study composition and arrangement, but haven't start yet.
                </br>&emsp; • Want to reinvent the wheel.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Ideals</h3>
                &emsp; • I yearn for a free lifestyle, and believe every individual should have the maximum freedom.
                </br>&emsp; • I believe that by developing the artificial intelligence, no human work will be required, which will lead to the "Communism" where material resources is almost unlimited.
                </br>&emsp; • I'm willing to contribute to the realization of such "Communism".
            </p>
